# Annunaki and Portapolis

Annunaki was an attempt to make a Unity 3D clone of the Impressions City Building Series, which includes Caesar III and Pharaoh. I wrote weekly devlogs on /r/annunakigame before deciding to abandon the project in its current state for being too messy (and because at the time, I had no free time to work on it consistently).

Portapolis is about as close to the Annunaki source code as I have and as is actually functional. It has a more architectural approach to its structure, which makes it easier to add onto and develop instead of being fairly ad-hoc and hardcoded like its predecessor. It also includes a bunch of little improvements here and there, as well as the groundwork for mobile controls.

This version of Portapolis dates to around March 2018. Although I've technically been working on the same project since, it has since evolved into something different and this is the oldest version of Portapolis that I can recover. On the plus side, it doesn't have anything quite foreign to the Impressions Games series.

I may go back to this and push some commits that include various improvements I've made in the current project that aren't mutually exclusive with the idea of basically a Pharaoh clone (improved labor allocation, building placement, etc). For now, though, I think this is just fine to publish. I will not be posting any of my current project publicly, but this repo of Portapolis is public and GPL 3.0. This means you can use it for learning, curiosity, or even fun if you find that in this prototype. However, you can't use any of the code here for private purposes etc. Check out LICENSE.txt for more details.

Thank you for reading! :smile: If there's anything you want to ask about feel free to email me or make a post here.
